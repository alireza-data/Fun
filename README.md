# Fun
Take it easy, this is just fun

A Python script that automatically increments a number in a text file, commits the change to Git, and updates a cron job to run the script at a new random time. 
This is just for fun and doesn't mean that I am maintaining a regular commit streak or tracking sequential values with a dynamic schedule.
